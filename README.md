# Music Streaming User Behavior Prediction and Song Recommendation

This ML (Machine Learning) model is designed to predict user behavior on a music streaming platform and provide personalized song recommendations based on their preferences.

## Features

- **User Behavior Prediction**: The model analyzes user interactions, such as listening history, likes, and dislikes, to predict their behavior patterns.
- **Song Recommendations**: Using these behavior patterns, the model suggests songs that align with the user's tastes and preferences.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Gather user data and interactions on the music streaming platform.
2. **Training**: Train the ML model on the collected data to learn user behavior patterns.
3. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict user behavior and recommend songs accordingly.

This project can enhance the user experience on music streaming platforms by offering tailored song recommendations.
